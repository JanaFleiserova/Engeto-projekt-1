# Engeto-projekt-1
Text analyzer as the first project for the Engeto academy.

The text analyzer offers registered users an analysis of any length of text. 
After selecting the text, it will return: 
the number of words,
the number of words starting with a capital letter,
the number of words written in uppercase,
the number of words written in lowercase,
the number of numerals,
the sum of all numerals in the text. 
Finally, it will display a simple graph showing the occurence of different word lengths.
